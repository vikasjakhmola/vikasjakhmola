## Docker Quick Start üê≥

Coming soon
This section will explain how you can quickly use this image with `Docker` or `Docker-compose`.

### Prerequisites

Before you can use either `Docker` or `Docker-compose`, please ensure you do have the following prerequisites met.

1. **Docker** installed - [link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. **Docker-composed** installed (if using Docker-compose) - [link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
3. **Credentials** configured - This can be done manually or by running the `make setup` command from the root of this repo

**Important**: Your container will fail if you do not do step #3 and configure your credentials

### Docker

If docker is installed you can build an image and run this as a container.

Build:

```bash
docker build -t osintgram .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD/output:/home/osintgram/output" osintgram <target>
```

* The `<target>` is the Instagram account you wish to use as your target for recon.
* The required `-i` flag enables an interactive terminal to use commands within the container. [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#assign-name-and-allocate-pseudo-tty---name--it)
* The required `-v` flag mounts a volume between your local filesystem and the container to save to the `./output/` folder. [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#mount-volume--v---read-only)
* The optional `--rm` flag removes the container filesystem on completion to prevent cruft build-up. [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#clean-up---rm)
* The optional `-t` flag allocates a pseudo-TTY which allows colored output. [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#foreground)

### Using `docker-compose`

You can use the `docker-compose.yml` file this single command:

```bash
docker-compose run osintgram <target>
```

Where `target` is the Instagram target for recon.

Alternatively you may run `docker-compose` with the `Makefile`:

* `make run` - Builds and Runs with compose. Prompts for a `target` before running.

### Makefile (easy mode)

For ease of use with Docker-compose, a `Makefile` has been provided.

Here is a sample work flow to spin up a container and run `osintgram` with just two commands!

1. `make setup`   - Sets up your Instagram credentials
2. `make run`     - Builds and Runs a osintgram container and prompts for a target

Sample workflow for development:

1. `make setup`          - Sets up your Instagram credentials
2. `make build-run-testing`   - Builds an Runs a container without invoking the `main.py` script. Useful for an `it` Docker session for development
3. `make cleanup-testing`     - Cleans up the testing container created from `build-run-testing`
